# Dream
A project to simulate Minecraft 1.16 speedruns using datapacks and Monte Carlo simulations.

# Background
In 2020, accusations came forward that popular YouTuber Dream had cheated on some of his minecraft speed runs given his above average luck in drop rates for 2 key items: ender pearls from piglin barters and blaze rods from blaze kills.

In 2021, Dream revealed that the runs in question were in fact using a datapack to increase ender pearl and blaze rod drops.
